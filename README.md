# <em>__Markdown__</em> Notes

in progress ...

# Goal
My goal of this project is to try out creating an [Electron App](https://www.electronjs.org/).  This project will give me a space to try out some new concepts without needing to worry about deploying / users / etc. like I might with a web app.  Also I have been wanting a note taking app focused on a single daily note, almost like a <em>diary</em> :), this is how I find I write my notes, with a few notes that I ALWAYS refrence.  Apple Notes is note cutting it, so I am making my own!

# Figma 
[Check out the Figma Preview here!](https://www.figma.com/file/xliaNuz3CFVAPSECgs4fSa/MarkdownNotes?node-id=0%3A1&frame-preset-name=Desktop)

### Main Page
The main page will have a section for Global Notes (these will be notes that area always refrenced, essentialy ones you want to star / favorite or whatever).  Another section will be a list of daily notes, the calendar next to it will be scrollable so you can go back and select a date and it will auto scroll the daily notes to that date.

After Selecting a date the daily notes will auto scroll to that date for you, here is an example of the view after selecting Jan 1, 2021.

### View Note
Of course one of the most important parts is viewing the notes! Clicking on a note will open up the note.

### Create / Edit Note
Just as important is creating and editing the note.  In this view you will be able to edit the title, body, and if it is a __Global Note__ or __Daily Note__.  While you write your markdown note, you will see the preview updated in the right section.
